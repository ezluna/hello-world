# GoogleQuest Competition

The intention of this project is to develop a model that will predict target values of 30 different question-answer labels. The question-answer subjects for training and testing were gathered from nearly 70 different StackExchange websites. More details can be found at Kaggle's competition website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge/overview
